# Exceptions
I intend to use the methodology described on this website, wherever my reputation matters, in perpetuity. However, there are legitimate exceptions, such as:

* *Not worth it*: the time or effort to provide strong evidence may not be justified by low-stakes circumstances. For example, I might fill out a customer survey for someone that only needs low assurance of my identity.
* *No control*: I might be required to use other trust mechanisms to participate in a foreign ecosystem. For example, I might have to use a username and password on websites run by governments or online retailers.
* *Other trust*: I might be interacting with a private individual that has other ways of recognizing me, and other reasons to trust me.

Note that more than one of these reasons may be relevant at the same time, and that this list is suggestive, not exhaustive. The principle that should always remain true is that I will strive to be as authentic as needed and possible, given circumstances. If you wonder about my authenticity, I invite you to ask. I can then produce stronger evidence.
