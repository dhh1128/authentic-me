# Why trust this source?

This is an important question. DO NOT skip over it lightly. Someone attempting to abuse my identity could easily publish a web page claiming to be from me, with a different answer to this question. You should not accept any alternative source of information about me, unless it exceeds the bar for evidence that I'm setting here.

1. I have published a corroborating announcement in various locations. These are locations on and off the web, using independently managed and world class infrastructure, that I have controlled for many years. Most, I have used under public scrutiny, so my control of them is provable using the wayback machine on archive.org. The announcement establishes a personal root of trust according to the rules explained here, and based on [my root identifier](identifiers/root.md). Each announcement points to this website (https://dhh1128.github.io/trust), cross-references all other copies, and carry signatures from the keys associated with my root identifier. The corroborating announcements are located at:

    * LinkedIn
    * Facebook
    * X (formerly Twitter)
    * DNS TXT record for codecraft.co
    * DNS TXT record for sivanea.com 
    * Document published on Google Docs
    * My author profile on amazon.com
    * A safety deposit box at a bank

1. The browsable version of this content is hosted by GitHub pages, at https://dhh1128.github.io/trust. The content from which the site derives is hosted in three places independently: https://github.com/dhh1128/trust, https://bitbucket.org/daniel-hardman/trust, and https://gitlab.com/dhh1128/trust. In order to trust what I say here, all three sources MUST agree on the full git history, and the web site's state MUST derive from the source code.

1. The code for this web site evolves according to git commits. Each git commit MUST be signed by my git code commit key.
