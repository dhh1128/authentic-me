## Principles

1. <a id="identifiers">Identifiers</a>: I will create identifiers that are bound to cryptographic keys.
1. <a id="contexts">Contexts</a>: I will use different identifiers for different contexts.
1. <a id="resolution">Resolution</a>: I will publicly explain how my identifiers can be resolved to cryptographic keys.
1. <a id="care">Care</a>: I will control access to my keys with great care.
1. <a id="signatures">Signatures</a>: I will sign with my identifiers and their associated keys to make non-repudiable assertions that I have seen content. If the content asserts something in my name, then my signature will further commit me to whatever semantics are embodied by that assertion.
1. <a id="delegation">Delegation</a>: I will formally sign delegation statements to convey subsets of my authority, and I will specify in such statements the constraints that I intend. 
1. <a id="encryption">Encryption</a>: When I intend confidentiality, I will also use my keys to encrypt communications.  
1. <a id="cleanup">Cleanup</a>: I will rotate keys that I no longer use, revoke my signature over content that I disclaim, and repudiate things that are wrongly associated with me. 
1. <a id="correlation">Correlation</a>: In some cases I will create proofs of existence as evidence of authoriship or sequence. In some cases I will correlate my digital activities with physical and/or legal evidence to provide extra assurance.
1. <a id="publication">Publication</a>: I will keep an accurate, auditable, public record about all of this here, on this site and on other places referenced here.
