## Tech
Generally, my methods reflect learnings from [KERI](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/). I will also apply techniques from the [Trust Spanning Protocol](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-tsp-specification/), [DIDComm](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/), [Hyperledger Aries](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/projects/aries) and the W3C [Decentralized Identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) specs. All of these are important technologies, built by very smart people that I know well. I freely credit the associated inventors, disclaim any cleverness on my part, and accept any criticisms if I apply their ideas imperfectly.

However, I am going base my trust on the *principles* in these technologies, rather than on *implementations* or even *specifications* of them. That's because:

1. I expect implementations and specifications to evolve, but I need my personal trust mechanisms to be stable for decades.
2. I want anyone who interacts with me to be able to prove things to their satisfaction, regardless of tech that they may or may not understand or use.

I will provide some convenience tools on this website to create and prove evidence. However, anything I create and anything you need to prove can be processed with simple, stable, commodity tools that you find on your own. I'll suggest them where appropriate.
